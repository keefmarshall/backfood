Overview
========

Backfood connects a presenter with their audience to get direct feedback, as well as logging attendance.

You might be a university tutor holding a lecture, a conference speaker or a junior doctor explaining something to a small group of medical students and you want to know who you're talking to, and what they think.

Backfood works in any situation where you need a simple way to get quick feedback.

Presenter
---------

As the presenter, you need to create your event. This is as simple as going to [backfood.herokuapp.com](http://backfood.herokuapp.com) and clicking "Create Event" - the first time you access you'll also have to enter your name, but there's no registration process, no email address or password required.

After creating your event, you'll see a dashboard screen with a large QR code on it - this is the big black-and-white square with dots in, you'll have seen them all over the place, but perhaps didn't know what they were called before.

You need to display that QR code somewhere that your attendees can see it. That might be on a big screen, as part of your presentation  - you can just drag and drop it into PowerPoint if you want - or you might print out copies of the screen and leave it near the entrance, which also gives people a piece of paper to leave feedback on if they don't have a smart phone. If you have it on your own phone's screen, just show it to your attendees right there.


Attendee
--------

As an attendee, your presenter will have given you a QR code somehow, either on screen or on a piece of paper. If you don't have a smart phone with a camera and internet access, stop reading now, find a pencil and write your feedback on that piece of paper.

For those of you who are still here, if you don't already have one, you'll need to install a QR code reader onto your phone. There are lots of these freely available - for Android I use ZXing's "Barcode Scanner" app but many others are available, and on iPhone and Blackberry too.

Point the reader at the QR code and follow the link to check in. The first time you use it, you'll have to enter your name (which will be shown to the presenter). You'll get a big box to enter feedback, so go ahead and then submit. Done!

Although your name is shown in the attendance list, the feedback you give is anonymous.
